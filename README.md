**Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning**

**üìã Overview**

This project applies machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data.
**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  were implemented and compared to identify the champion model with the best performance.

**üéØ Objectives**

- Analyze a heart disease dataset to identify key factors affecting heart health.

- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models for disease prediction.

- Compare models using accuracy and performance metrics to select the best (champion) model.

- Provide an interpretable and data-driven solution for early heart disease detection.

**üß† Machine Learning Models**
| Model                            | Description                                       | Key Characteristics                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**    | Classifies based on the closest data points       | Simple, non-parametric, sensitive to feature scaling |
| **Decision Tree**                | Splits data into branches based on decision rules | Easy to interpret, prone to overfitting              |
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | Finds the optimal hyperplane for classification   | Works well with high-dimensional data                |

**üèÜ Champion Model**

After evaluation, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model achieved the highest accuracy and was selected as the champion model for heart disease prediction.
